1) IRIS_mSEED_DL.py: Script to perform automated, simultaneous download (using Selenium and Chrome) of a day of IRIS data in 2-hr chunks
  - Packages required: selenium, webdriver-manager
  - Download ChromeDriver here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
  - webdrive-manager automatically uses the correct ChromeDriver so you do not have to re-download the latest version each Chrome update
  - Modify the download URL to match your specific IRIS URL, which should have a similar format
  - Provide your username and password in the download URL if required, otherwise remove "user:password@"
  - Code can be modified to download from different time windows and and in different chunks
  - We used 2-hr chunks here to prevent extremely large file sizes and to speed up the process through simultaneous downloads
