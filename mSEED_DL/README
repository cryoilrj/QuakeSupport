1) IRIS_mSEED_DL.py: Script to perform automated, simultaneous download (using Selenium and Chrome) of a day of IRIS data in 2-hr chunks
  - Packages required: selenium, webdriver-manager
  - Download ChromeDriver here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
  - webdrive-manager automatically uses the correct ChromeDriver so you do not have to re-download the latest version every Chrome update
  - Provide your username and password in the download URL if required, otherwise remove "user:password@"
  - Code can be modified to download from different time windows and chunks; 2-hr chunks help to prevent overly large file sizes and speed up the process
