1) IRIS_mSEED_DL.py: Script to perform automated, simultaneous download (using Selenium and Chrome) of a day of IRIS data in 2-hr chunks
  - Packages required: selenium, webdriver-manager
  - Download ChromeDriver here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
  - webdrive-manager automatically uses the correct ChromeDriver so you do not have to re-download the latest version each Chrome update
  - Modify the download URL to match your specific IRIS URL, which should have a similar format
  - Provide your username and password in the download URL if required, otherwise remove "user:password@"
  - Code can be modified to download from different time windows and in different chunks
  - 2-hr chunks were used here to prevent extremely large file sizes and to speed up the process through simultaneous downloads
  - TODO: Close browser after download completes

2) stAlign.py: Script to align stream trace times
  - Packages required: ObsPy
  - If your sampling period > decimal precision specified for your traces, the traces can have time offsets < sampling period
  - This is not a serious problem, as the trace times are still considered similar and the data length is the same
  - In fact, QuakeMigrate does the exact same shifting when processing the traces. However, a message is generated for each shift which clogs up the logs
  - e.g., "Trace 5B.16611..GPZ | 2019-01-28T14:59:55.350998Z - 2019-01-28T15:01:10.000998Z | 500.0 Hz, 37326 samples has off-sample data. Applying -0.000998 s shift to timing."
  - This scripts helps to avoid the message spam during QuakeMigrate runs by nominally aligning the stream trace times
